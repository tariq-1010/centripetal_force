# centripetal_force
This jQuery animation can help you to understand centripetal force and can be a helping code for beginners.
Like the word states "Centri=>Center=>Centre" Pe "PI" Force; is an energy that is needed to cross a value of PI; for example we know pathline from Kualalumpur Malaysia to Beijing China is very sensitive line; because it is close to the edges of the globe; to move on this line thing which is important is basically force; if force is not applied with right precission and accuracy it can leave the aeroplane pulled in space; it is matter of parallel universes; to read more about centripetal force please follow https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force. So what is truth behind the parallel universes? Earth is one object; it can generate its another copy; for example same way the way soap bubbles are; one to many; we can say each soap bubble is one earth; moon, sun, mars, neptune etc. are also different types of earths; and one can say there is life and population as well; for example there are scientists in the space agency; for one scientist there is water on the mars and for other scientist there is no water on the mars; both are not wrong; because the scientist one who is saying there is water on the mars; his soul response (body environment) is returning him water on the mars; for example we inhale oxygen; water formula we know is H2O; this chemistry naturally returns us water naturally when we see a surface; water or other elements like trees, buildings, food, etc. forms on our body temperature; the way rainbow forms over environmental particles and it is stacked mean computed one after one color; same way the origin of computer is; there was one aeroplane which went missing 10 years ago Malaysian Airline MH370; keeping in mind matter of parallel universes; we can say that it took off from EARTH1 KUALALUMPUR and its target was EARTH1 BEIJING; but it has deviated its root path because of may be hard coded value of PI which did not alert flight officer in cockpit; and it is now going to EARTH2 BEIJING; for example we see blue color in the rainbow; here we can think about a galaxy; which has many color; where there is blue color in the galaxy; we can say there are lots many earths like EARTH1, EARTH2, EARTH3, EARTH4, EARTH5 . . ; certainly there is space between each earth; here one can think how it can be moving without fuel; it is something like a paper plane or something like kite; when it reaches at a space height like an eagle we see in the space; it does not need fuel to move; it works over magnetic pull; the way for example pulsars work;
